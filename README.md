# E04a-Sprites Exercise

This is an exercise to start experimenting with sprites in Python Arcade. This repository assumes that you have Python Arcade installed.

The exercise takes place across three files:

 * main1.py:
   * The panda is feeling lonely. Change main1.py so that 20 random animals are displayed on the screen.
   I could only generate one image at a time. I adjusted the code in many different ways and searched for possible solutions online without any luck. 

   * You will need to edit lines 26–32 to accomplish this assignment
   * To repeat something 20 times, you can use a loop:
     * for i in range(20):
     * will set i = 0, i = 1, i = 2, etc. until i = 19
   * To get a random element of a list, you can use:
     * animal = random.choice(animals)
   * To get a random location:
     * x = random.randint(0,800)
     * y = random.randint(0,600)
 * main2.py:
   * The aligator would like someone to talk to. Move her over and add a second animal with a (corresponding) speech bubble.
   This was surprisingly easy to do. I simply copied the same code and made minor adjustments to create a corresponding image. 
   * You will need to edit lines 48–56 to accomplish this assignment
   * self.animal_list and self.emote_list are lists of sprites that all get updated together
   * The .append() method adds an element to a list
   * Choose another animal from the assets folder, and then update the X,Y coordinates for the two animals and speech bubbles
 * main3.py:
   * The moose would like to be more mobile. Change the code so the moose follows the mouse around the screen.
   * You will need to edit line 40 to accomplish this assignment
   * If you look on lines 25–26, you will see that the sprite location is set using the center_x and center_y attributes
   * The moose is now part of the self.animal_list, so you will need to update the element(s) of that list:
     * for a in self.animal_list:
     I was very happy when I completed this. I had to do some outside google search for how to complete this and was able to move the moose around with the mouse. Feeling very accomplished. 
 * main4.py—*extra credit*:
   * Find some other sprites, and make them into a collage
   * Using what you have learned in the other exercise files, draw at least ten sprites in the window
   * [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl) or [openGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org) are resources for free images
   * If you would like to make them move or react to the mouse, I will award extra points
   Did not have enough time to work on this part of the assignment. 

As usual, fork and clone this repository. Edit the LICENSE and README.md, and submit the URL of your repository to Canvas.
